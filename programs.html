      <h2>TB Dignity Fund</h2>
      <p>Our TB Dignity Fund provides essential support to individuals and their families during active TB treatment. We deliver care packages filled with groceries, cleaning supplies, hygiene products, household items, and clothing—the everyday essentials that help people maintain dignity and stability during months of treatment.</p>
      <p>Every package is tailored to individual needs, ensuring people have what matters most to them. We also provide mobile phones and phone plans to help maintain the essential connection between individuals going through TB treatment and their care team.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Food Pantry</h2>
      <p>We maintain an on-site pantry at the SF TB Clinic stocked with food, hygiene items, clothing, and household essentials. This enables clinic staff to meet their patients' needs immediately.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Mutual Aid Fund</h2>
      <p>Our Mutual Aid Fund responds to urgent, larger needs that arise during treatment—emergency housing, major medical expenses, or family crises that require immediate financial intervention. This fund allows us to act quickly when families face situations that could derail their treatment or destabilize their lives.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Advocacy & Community Building</h2>
      <p>We advocate for resources and policies that improve the quality of TB care for the populations we serve. Together Against TB is a proud member of the <a href="https://ctca.org/coalition-for-a-tb-free-ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coalition for a TB-Free California</a>.</p>
