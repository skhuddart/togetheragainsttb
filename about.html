    <div class="container about-content">
      <p>Together Against TB is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded on World TB Day 2024. Founded by TB researchers, we launched with a simple but powerful belief: no one should go through TB treatment alone.</p>

      <p>TB treatment is hard on individuals and families. We saw neighbors in San Francisco facing impossible choices—between paying rent and buying groceries, between transportation to medical appointments and other essentials. We knew we could do more to show up for our community.</p>

      <p>Together Against TB was created to be nimble and responsive, meeting people exactly where they are with exactly what they need. We work directly with the San Francisco Department of Public Health TB Clinic to identify and support individuals and families navigating TB treatment in San Francisco and the broader Bay Area.</p>

      <p>As members of the San Francisco TB community—researchers, clinicians, advocates—we stand with every person facing this journey.</p>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <blockquote class="mission-statement">
        We are dedicated to supporting the mental, physical, social, and financial health of individuals affected by tuberculosis in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Through direct aid, mutual support, and community connection, we ensure that no one faces TB treatment alone.
